# Dockerfile Highlights

This project uses a **multi-stage Docker build**.

### Builder Stage

- Uses Node.js Alpine image
- Installs project dependencies
- Copies application source code

### Production Stage

- Uses lightweight Alpine image
- Copies only required application files
- Creates a non-root user
- Runs the application securely

### Benefits

- Smaller production image
- Faster deployments
- Better security
- Improved layer caching

# Docker Compose Services

The application consists of two containers.

## Application

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Port 3000

## Database

- MongoDB 8
- Persistent Docker Volume
- Healthcheck using `mongosh`

Docker Compose also creates:

- Custom Docker Network
- Named Docker Volume

# Quick Start

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Jaishree97/90DaysOfDevOps.git
```

## 2. Navigate to the Project

```bash
cd 2026/day-36/task-manager-api
```

## 3. Build the Docker Images

```bash
docker compose build
```

## 4. Start the Application

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

# Verify Running Containers

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Expected output:

```text
mongodb             Up (healthy)
task-manager-app    Up
```

---

# View Application Logs

```bash
docker compose logs app
```

Expected output:

```text
MongoDB Connected
Server running on port 3000
```

-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title":"Learn Docker","completed":false}'
```

## Update Task

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/tasks/<TASK_ID> \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"completed":true}'
```

## Delete Task
